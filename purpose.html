            Tibeb Girls: The Issue
          </h1>
          <p>
            In a place such as Ethiopia, where social supports are often
            inadequate, adolescent girls struggle to find a path into a healthy
            and secure adult life. Many adolescent girls struggle with limited
            access to high-quality education while simultaneously facing
            traditional practices such as child marriage and health risks such
            as high maternal death rates and HIV infection. According to Girl
            Up, a campaign of the United Nations foundation, only 38% of girls
            and young women between the ages of 15-24 in Ethiopia are literate,
            one in five girls is married before the age of 15, and girls ages
            15-19 are seven times more likely to be HIV positive than their male
            peers. Furthermore, 12% of girls between the ages of fifteen and
            nineteen are mothers or pregnant with their first child.

              Our Vision
            </h1>
            <p>
              We are excited to introduce a new action-drama radio show about
              three young girls who use their superpowers to fight against
              injustice and the many harmful practices Ethiopian girls routinely
              face. Using their powers to see the past and future, Tibeb Girls
              draws the audience into the typical lives of Ethiopian girls,
              building empathy for their hardship and a vision of a brighter
              future. Tibeb Girls puts girls’ issues at the center and provides
              examples of girls asserting themselves, problem-solving, and
              implementing solutions. By broadcasting a program that will
              examine harmful practices and explore girls’ agency in addressing
              those challenges, Tibeb Girls will foster a culture of
              conversation among girls, families, and throughout the broader
              community. Through our partnerships detailed below, the Tibeb
              Girls is an Ethiopian-led, innovative, scalable and sustainable
              approach to measurably improving coordination around girls’ issues
              in Ethiopia.

            Future Plans for the Tibeb Girls
          </h1>
          <p>
            While at this point, we are seeking support for the initial pilot
            season of the Tibeb Girls, we are looking at how the program can
            grow in the future. With characters and general storylines
            established, the second year will yield 13 radio and 13 television
            episodes. The final year will again build on efficiencies and result
            in 13 radio and 26 television episodes. Printed comics reinforcing
            the messages of the Tibeb Girls can be printed and distributed.
